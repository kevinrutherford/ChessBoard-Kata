Feature: Taking a piece

    In order to play chess
    As a Player
    I want to be able to take the oppositions piece.

  Scenario: Pawn Takes the Knight
    Given I have a White Pawn at D3
    And I have a Black knight at C4
    When the pawn moves to C4
    Then the knight should be taken
    And the pawn should be at C4
    And I should be shown "Pawn takes Knight. Pawn wins"

  Scenario: Pawn collides with Knight.
    Given I have a White Pawn at C3
    And I have a Black knight at C4
    When the pawn moves to C4
    Then the knight should be at C4
    And the pawn should be at C3
    And I should be shown "Pawn collides with Knight. Draw"

  Scenario: Knight takes Pawn.
    Given I have a Black knight at D6
    And I have a White Pawn at F6
    And the Pawn moves to F7
    When I move the Knight to F7
    Then the pawn should be taken
    And I should be shown "Knight takes Pawn. Knight Wins"
